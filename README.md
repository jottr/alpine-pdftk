[`pdftk`](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit) in docker.

To run `docker run --rm -v "${PWD}":/files jottr/alpine-pdftk`.  
For your convenience you can source the `pdftk`-script.

Sadly `pdftk` has been discontinued. Alpine 3.8 is the latest version that still packages `pdftk`.  

[`Stapler`](https://github.com/hellerbarde/stapler) looks like a worthy successor.
